# Multicellular Systems Biology Group
This repo hosts [Chaste](https://Chaste.github.io) Projects related to the [Multicellular Systems Biology Group](https://osborne-group.science.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne.

## [CellBasedNumericalMethods](https://github.com/jmosborne/CellBasedNumericalMethods)
Code for J.M. Osborne "An adaptive numerical method for multi-cellular simulations of organ development and disease" [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.06.574290v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.06.574290v1)

## [TissueBoundaries](https://github.com/jmosborne/TissueBoundaries)
Code for D.P.J. Germano, A. Zanca, S.T. Johnston, J.A. Flegg & J.M. Osborne "Free and Interfacial Boundaries in Individual-Based Models of Multicellular Biological systems" [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-023-01214-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-023-01214-8)

## [SBMLChaste](https://github.com/jmosborne/SBMLChaste)
This project contains the code necesary for generating SRN and CCM models from SBML and running the simulations presented in Romjin et al. "Modelling the effect of subcellular mutations on the migration of cells in the colorectal crypt". [(https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3391-3](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3391-3)
